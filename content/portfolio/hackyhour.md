### Hacky Hour

Want to Open up your research practices but want some help? Do you have an idea for an R package and want some coding buddies? Are you struggling for a way to explain open data to your participants? Do you want to promote openness but don't know how? Come and hang out with fellow travellers. 

This weekly catch up will give you an opportunity to chat with other open researchers and share ideas and projects. Currently scheduled to run on the Burwood campus at BC Level 1 (near the package lockers) on **Tuesdays at 3pm**. 

Not sure what you might do? [Here are some ideas](https://osf.io/be7yt/wiki/Hacky%20Hour%20Projects/).
